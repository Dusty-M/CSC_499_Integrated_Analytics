# CSC 499: Final Report

_Please submit a final report describing the project that you have worked on throughout the semester_

## Objectives

The final report should showcase the work that you have done this semester on your independent project in a semi-formal format. It provides the basis on which to evaluate the prototype that you have designed and built. You should aim for:

 * Clarity of exposition
 * Value proposition for the project
 * Clear, clean design
 * A functional prototype
 * Analysis of how well the design/prototype fulfills the value proposition
 * Future potential


## Formatting

Please submit a PDF file using at most six pages in the standard double-column ACM format. If you are comfortable with LaTeX, I highly recommend using it: the LaTeX template is [available on Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-new-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt). If you prefer to use Microsoft Word (or a similar .docx editor such as Google Docs), you can start from this [word template](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word_style/interim-template-style/interim-layout.docx). The formatting guidelines aren't a strict requirement, but will help ensure that the report is an appropriate length.

You should have 4-10 scientific references in your bibliography, plus references to any tools or datasets that you use. The format of the references is not crucial, but you must include a digital object identifier (DOI).

## Content

The report should consist of seven sections:

 1. Introduction (describing the high-level goals of the project and why it is interesting, probably with reference to scientific literature)
 2. Background (describing any technical background required to understand the report that cannot be assumed of a general computer scientist)
 3. Design (describing what you have created at a level of abstractions and algorithms)
 4. Prototype (illustrating the prototype and its functionality or interactivity)
 5. Evaluation (describing the quality of the design, in this case in terms of accuracy and performance relative to # of segments)
 6. Conclusion (summarising the report and suggesting future directions to investigate)
 7. References

You are free to name or order the sections differently. The references do not contribute towards the page limit.

## Evaluation

The report will be evaluated holistically against [the descriptors given by the UVic English department](https://www.uvic.ca/humanities/english/undergraduate/resources/firstyeargrading/index.php). The midpoint percentage of the corresponding letter grade will be awarded. The evaluation will centre on how well the aforementioned objectives have been met.

You are encouraged to submit a self-evaluation with a 100 word justification along with your report.
